# BallsOnThreads

Project made for university subject.

Aim is to learn working with threads in C++.

Additional library userd is ncurses which allowed easily visualization of the problem.

Task was to create threads of balls that would move with initial random velocity and also would be affected by gravity.
Second task was to create line moving from side to side of the screen that on touch with ball would stick it to herself
and in queue would move them downhill.
